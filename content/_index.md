{{< lead >}} MultiPRIDE: Multilingual Automatic Detection of Reclamation of Slurs in the LGBTQ+ Context{{< /lead >}}

Welcome to MultiPRIDE web page! ðŸŒˆ
MultiPRIDE (Multilingual Automatic Detection of Reclamation of Slurs in the LGBTQ+ Context) is part of **Evalita 2026**, the 9th evaluation campaign of Natural Language Processing and Speech tools for Italian, which will take place in **Bari, Italy, on February 26â€“27, 2026**.

Social networks have become the primary means of communication for most people. The growth of online interactions has raised a new challenge for Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems: the ability to detect and prevent the spread of offensive content â€“as Hate Speech (HS) and abusive languageâ€“ targeting specific groups, while also safeguarding freedom of expression and promoting inclusive and fair communication. This is particularly relevant in the case of **semantic reclamation**, a phenomenon in which words historically used as slurs are reappropriated by targeted communities, gaining new, empowering, or neutral meanings. In these contexts, such terms often lose their offensive intent and instead express a sense of belonging and solidarity among the group members (Bianchi, 2014 [[1]](#1), Cepollaro, 2023 [[2]](#2)). 

The MultiPRIDE task will focus on identifying reclaimed slurs, in Italian, Spanish and English, within  the context of the LGBTQ+ community.

### Target Audience

The task is open to everyone from industry and academia. In particular, we encourage the participation of researchers, industrial teams, and students.
